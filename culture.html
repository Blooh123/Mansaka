                    <h3>Spiritual Leadership: The Baylan</h3>
                    <p>The Mansaka have traditional spiritual leaders called <strong>Baylan</strong> (plural: <strong>Balyan</strong>), who serve as priests, healers, and crucial mediators between the people and the spiritual realm. The Balyan commune with <strong>Magbabaya</strong>, the supreme being or deity in Mansaka spirituality.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Role of Balyan</h3>

                        <li><strong>Spiritual Guidance:</strong> Leading rituals, ceremonies, and spiritual practices</li>

                    <h3>Historical Isolation & Modern Changes</h3>
                    <p>Historically, many Baylans lived in isolation, close to the forest, to commune with nature and spirits, maintaining intense spiritual practice. Today, only a few Baylans remain who maintain close spiritual practices; many have moved closer to urban areas, affecting traditional spiritual connections and the transmission of spiritual knowledge to younger generations.</p>

                    <h3>Oral Traditions</h3>
                    <p>The Mansaka have a rich tradition of <strong>songs, oral stories, riddles, and poems</strong>—many of which are recited and preserved by the Baylan during rituals and community gatherings. These traditions encode cultural knowledge, historical memory, and moral teachings essential to Mansaka identity.</p>

                    <p>In the liorot method, meats and root crops are placed inside a <strong>hollow bamboo tube</strong> along with aromatic herbs, then cooked over fire. The typical ingredients include:</p>
                    <ul class="culture-list">
                        <li>Proteins: Meat (pork, chicken, fish)</li>
                        <li>Root Vegetables: Taro, sweet potato, other tubers</li>
                        <li>Aromatics: Lemongrass, ginger, salt, pepper</li>
                        <li>Cooking Method: Sealed bamboo tube roasted over open fire</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>The Result</h3>
                    <p>The bamboo acts as an "enclosed oven," trapping steam and heat to slowly cook the ingredients. The result is an incredibly flavorful dish where the food absorbs the subtle taste of bamboo while remaining moist and tender. The sealed environment creates its own microclimate for perfect cooking.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Cultural Significance</h3>
                    <p>In modern times, liorot is often prepared only for special occasions or when hosting visitors, representing a cherished link to traditional practices. The dish embodies generations of culinary wisdom and remains a point of cultural pride for Mansaka families.</p>
