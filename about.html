            <div class="content-grid">
                <div class="content-text">
                    <p>The Mansaka people have inhabited the mountainous regions of what is now Davao de Oro (formerly known as Compostela Valley) for centuries. Their history is intertwined with the broader narrative of Philippine indigenous peoples, known collectively as Lumads, who predate colonial settlements in Mindanao.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Pre-Colonial Era</h3>
                    <p>Long before Spanish and American colonial presence, the Mansaka developed a sophisticated system of social organization, governance, and resource management. They established trade networks with neighboring communities and maintained a deeply spiritual connection to their ancestral lands. Their oral histories, preserved through storytelling and cultural transmission, chronicle their origins and migrations within the mountainous terrain of Mindanao.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Colonial Period</h3>
                    <p>During the Spanish colonial period (1565-1898), the Mansaka, like other indigenous groups, resisted colonization and maintained their autonomy in remote upland areas. They successfully preserved their cultural identity and traditional practices despite external pressures. The difficult terrain of their homeland served as both refuge and protective barrier against colonial expansion.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Modern Era</h3>
                    <p>In contemporary times, the Mansaka continue to navigate the challenges of modern Philippine society while striving to maintain their cultural heritage. They have established educational programs, cultural organizations, and advocacy groups to ensure the survival of their traditions and language. Today, they remain an important part of the Philippines' indigenous cultural tapestry.</p>

            <div class="etymology-box">
                <p>The term "Mansaka" derives from two distinct linguistic roots with profound meaning:</p>

                        <h4>MAN</h4>
                        <p>Meaning "first" - indicating the Mansaka's significance as original inhabitants.</p>

                <div class="content-text">
                    <h3>Mainit Hot Spring: The Birthplace</h3>
                    <p>According to Mansaka tradition, their ancestral origin is deeply linked to a sacred place called <strong>Mainit Hot Spring</strong>. This natural hot spring is revered as the birthplace of the first Mansaka man, <strong>Inangsabong</strong>, the legendary ancestor from whom all Mansaka people descend.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Foundation Story</h3>
                    <p>Inangsabong is said to have had seven wives who settled in different areas of Compostela Valley. This divine union gave rise to the various Mansaka settlements and communities present today. Each settlement traces its lineage back to one of these seven wives, creating a network of related clans and family groups connected by blood and shared ancestry.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Sacred Connection</h3>
                    <p>Mainit Hot Spring remains a sacred site for the Mansaka people, representing their spiritual connection to the land and their ancestors. The hot spring is not merely a geographical location but a living symbol of Mansaka identity, continuity, and cultural heritage. For the Mansaka, this place embodies the beginning of their people and their unique relationship with the mountainous landscape of Davao de Oro.</p>

                    <h3>Primary Homeland</h3>
                    <p>The Mansaka live in and around <strong>Compostela Valley (ComVal)</strong>, Mindanao, now known as Davao de Oro. This mountainous region in northern Davao is the ancestral and cultural heartland of the Mansaka people, where the majority of their population continues to reside.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Traditional Rural Living</h3>
                    <p>Many Mansaka still live in rural villages throughout the region, maintaining traditional ways of life tied to the land. These communities preserve centuries-old practices in agriculture, craftsmanship, and cultural traditions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Modern Migration Patterns</h3>
                    <p>Some Mansaka have migrated to more urban areas, such as Tagum City, seeking educational and economic opportunities. This migration reflects the challenges of rural development and the desire for better access to schools and employment. However, many families maintain strong ties to their ancestral villages and return regularly to participate in cultural events and family gatherings.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Blended Lifestyles</h3>
                    <p>Today's Mansaka navigate a blend of traditional and modern lifestyles. While younger generations may work in urban centers and attend schools in cities, they continue to identify strongly with their heritage and participate in cultural practices and traditions.</p>
